I got tired of some websites letting you navigate with arrow keys, some not, so I made this basic chrome extension to add going forwards. Worked on every website I've tried so far but there may be some outliers.
I'm not too familiar with Chrome and I had some difficulty making it go backwards too so for now it only goes in one direction.

Add to chrome (chrome://extensions)
Set up shortcut (chrome://extensions/shortcuts)

Should work for any website that has the word "next" included to go to the next chapter. For chrome shortcuts you need to have a 2 button shortcut it's nice to bind a key to Ctrl+Right, I chose my 0 on numpad.
